Introduction

Types of Programming Language

Procedural Programming: 
Functions were earlier known as procedure.
Multiple procedures -> Execution starts from 1 procedure -> that procedure keeps on calling other procedures.
In procedural programming, data by itself can't do anything. Everything done to data is by procedures.

Sequential Programming:
Code executions happens line by line.

eg: C is procedural + sequential

Object Oriented Programming:
Object knows all its attributes and can handle the data.

eg: Animals - Dog, Cat, Lion, Snake

PP - In PP, procedure defines how data should behave using if conditions.
OOP - In OOP, data handles how to behave

Make Sound(animal) {
   if (animal == "cat") { print "meow" }
   if (animal == "dog") { print "bark" }
   if (animal == "snake") { print "shh" }
   ...
}
Here, there will be multiple procedures similar to Sound like Jump(). 
If any condition missed like if any animal cannot jump eg: snake. then can lead to problem.
